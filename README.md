### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have over 6 years of experience as a computer engineer, and have worked at startups working as freelancer (Upwork) and currently working ðŸ”­ at The Cooperative Legal Services as Software Developer. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, architecture, and async mechanisms).
